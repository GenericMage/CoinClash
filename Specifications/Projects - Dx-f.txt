1. Link Dollar (DOHL) 
Description: 

"A highly scalable and accurately price stable synthetic stablecoin making use of "LP Rebase".
The token achieves a price of $1 by fetching the POL/USD price from a Chainlink oracle and rebases a target QuickSwap liquidity pool (that holds wPOL/DOHL) based on the LP Rebase formula. 

$DOHL does not require collateral to remain stable, however, users may encounter slippage depending on how much they intend to trade and how much liquidity is available. 

Users may profit by providing liquidity.  This is because the rebase function increases or reduces the balance of all Liquidity Providers depending on demand. 

$DOHL takes a 0.05% fee on every external transfer, fees are distributed to Peng NFT holders via Marker DAO. 

$DOHL is tradable on CFAMM DEXs like QuickSwap and is intended as the base asset on Dexhune-P and Shock Space."

2. Marker DAO 
Description: 

"A DAO with "routines" that execute custom transactions at intervals voted on by DAO participants. DAO participants are holders of Peng NFTs. 

The DAO will be a proxy that can be upgraded by the DAO itself. 

All project domain names and contracts will be owned by the DAO.  

The DAO will vote on arbitrary functions to execute; such as emergency frontend updates - buying or selling assets with the DAO's balance - paying individuals, etc. 

DAO voting will require both ownership of a Peng NFT and permanent deductions of DOHL token units for votes. All proposals require at least 33.3% of NFTs voting on them to pass, with at least 51% upvotes in DOHL token units."

5. Shock Space Driver 
Description : 

"What We're Building 
A permissionless leverage trading platform based on Dexhune-P, allows any token on Polygon POS to be listed. Integrates scalable synthetic RWA (real world assets) primitives for fiat currencies and commodities via Chainlink data feeds.

Shock Space has (7) distinguishing qualities; 

A. Inverse Price Impact 
Positions create an inverse impact on price; longs decrease price, while shorts increase it. 
This is because the user's margin is added to the listing's market liquidity when the position is created, thereby altering the balance of tokens and affecting the price. 
Positions only have as much impact as the user's margin relative to the Listing contract's balance. 
Longs overall still increase price because the user has to buy the token in order to long it.

B. Paper Leverage 
Positions are created using "Paper Leverage" that is issued by the exchange rather than borrowed from a lender. With limitations based on how much leverage is used relative to the available liquidity. 

When a position closes; the leveraged amount is erased and the user is owed their excess margin - initial margin after fees and any profit or loss they may have made, payable in the opposing asset type (longs receive USD / Token-0, while shorts receive Token-1). 

Position closures create a unique order that is filled by opposing liquidity types either in the market liquidity or staked liquidity. 

C. Customizable Isolated Margin
Users can customize how much is used as initial margin or excess margin in isolated positions, this affects liquidation price and position health. 

D. Progressive Fees 
Fees are billed once with no funding or maintainence fees. Entry fees are billed based on leverage used, with a maximum of 99% fees at 100x leverage and minimum of 1% at 2x. 
Fees are paid to liquidity providers of the opposing side; longs pay fees to USD or [TOKEN-0] LPs, while shorts pay fees to [TOKEN-1] LPs. 

E. Cross Pairing and Cross Margin 
Shock Space allows cross paired listings between any (2) tokens while also providing a comprehensive cross margin experience on cross pairings.

F. Asset Types
Tokens on Polygon POS are directly listed, creating markets that respond to demand and arbitrage.

G. Micro-positions
Positions can be opened with as little as $0.1e-6 or lower!"

- Further Info 
Appears at the bottom of the page, reads; 
"All our dApps strive for utmost decentralization, all frontends will be deployed via IPFS and Blockchain domain names, with the ownership being given to our team multi-sig. All ownership will be subsequently relinquished to our DAO once the properties are fully audited and stress tested. Any ownable contracts will be treated in the same manner.
For assets outside Polygon POS, a "proxy DAO" will be created on the respective chain, these will use Axelar or similar cross-Chain messaging systems to fetch the addresses of our DAO participants and their respective stake."
